    <h3>
        General Information
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Vega is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Lyra. </li>
        <li> This star is relatively close at only 25 light-years (7.7 parsecs) from the Sun, and one of the most
            luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood. </li>
        <li>It is the fifth-brightest star in the night sky, and the second-brightest star in the northern celestial
            hemisphere, after Arcturus. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        Significance
    </h3>

    <p>
        Vega has been extensively studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed "arguably the next most
        important star in the sky after the Sun". Vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BCE and
        will be so again around the year 13,727. Vega is only about a tenth of the age of the Sun, but
        since it is 2.1 times as massive, its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun;
        both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their main sequence lifetimes. <br><br>
        Each night the positions of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star
        is located along the Earth's axis of rotation, it will remain in the same position and thus is called
        a pole star. The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process
        known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770 years, during
        which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that
        passes near several prominent stars. Vega is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.
        In 210,000 years, Vega will become the brightest star in the night sky,[34] and will peak in
        brightness in 290,000 years with an apparent magnitude of â€“0.81.<br><br>

    <h3>
        How to Find Vega
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>If it is midsummer, Vega can be observed almost directly overhead at mid-northern latitudes. At
            other times of the year, it's still visible at night in the Northern Hemisphere but stays lower
            above the horizon. In the Southern Hemisphere, the star appears low in the northern sky, visible
            from April to late September.
            of the year</li>
        <li>To find Vega in the sky, look for the Summer Triangle, a prominent asterism made up of Vega in Lyra,
            Altair
            in Aquila, and Deneb in Cygnus.</li>
        <li> Vega is the brightest of the three and can be seen as a bright bluish-white star. </li>
