            Vega
        </h1>

        <p>
            Vega is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Lyra. 
            This star is relatively close at only 25 light-years (7.7 parsecs) from the Sun, 
            and one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood. 
            It is the fifth-brightest star in the night sky, and the second-brightest star 
            in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus.<br> <br>

        <h3>
            How to Find Vega
        </h3>

        <p>
            Vega can be observed almost directly overhead during midsummer nights at mid-northern latitudes. 
            At other times of the year, itâ€™s still visible at night in the Northern Hemisphere but stays lower 
            above the horizon. In the Southern Hemisphere, the star appears low in the northern sky, visible 
            from April to late September. <br> <br>
            To find Vega in the sky, look for the Summer Triangle, a prominent asterism made up of Vega 
            in Lyra, Altair in Aquila, and Deneb in Cygnus. Vega is the brightest of the three and can 
            be seen as a bright bluish-white star. In the summer of the Northern Hemisphere, it rises 
            in the east right after it gets dark. In the Southern Hemisphere, the Triangle will appear 
            upside down, rising low on the northern horizon. <br> <br>
