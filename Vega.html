        General Information
    </h3>

    <p>

    <ol>
        <li>Vega is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Lyra. </li>
        <li> This star is relatively close at only 25 light-years (7.7 parsecs) from the Sun, and one of the most
            luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood. </li>
        <li>It is the fifth-brightest star in the night sky, and the second-brightest star in the northern celestial
            hemisphere, after Arcturus. </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>
        Significance
    </h3>

    <p>
        Vega has been extensively studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed "arguably the next most
        important star in the sky after the Sun". Vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BCE and
        will be so again around the year 13,727. <br><br>
        Each night the positions of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star 
        is located along the Earth's axis of rotation, it will remain in the same position and thus is called 
        a pole star. The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process 
        known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770 years, during 
        which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that 
        passes near several prominent stars. Vega is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.<br><br>

    <h3>
        How to Find Vega
    </h3>

    <p>
        Vega can be observed almost directly overhead during midsummer nights at mid-northern latitudes.
        At other times of the year, it's still visible at night in the Northern Hemisphere but stays lower
        above the horizon. In the Southern Hemisphere, the star appears low in the northern sky, visible
        from April to late September. <br> <br>
        To find Vega in the sky, look for the Summer Triangle, a prominent asterism made up of Vega
        in Lyra, Altair in Aquila, and Deneb in Cygnus. Vega is the brightest of the three and can
        be seen as a bright bluish-white star.

    <ul>
        <li>In the summer of the Northern Hemisphere, it rises in the east right after it gets dark. </li>
        <li>In the Southern Hemisphere, the Triangle will appear upside down, rising low on the northern horizon. </li>
    </ul>
