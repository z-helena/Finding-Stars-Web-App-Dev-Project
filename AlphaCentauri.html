                <p>
                    <i>Alpha Centauri</i> (Î± Centauri, Î± Cen, or Alpha Cen) is a triple star system in the southern
                    constellation of
                    Centaurus. It consists of three stars: Rigil Kentaurus (Î± Centauri A), Toliman (Î± Centauri B), and
                    Proxima
                    Centauri (Î± Centauri C). Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun at 4.2465 light-years
                    (1.3020
                    pc).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Î± Centauri A and B are Sun-like stars (class G and K, respectively) that together form the binary
                    star
                    system Î± Centauri AB. To the naked eye, these two main components appear to be a single star with an
                    apparent magnitude of âˆ’0.27 . It is the brightest star in the constellation and the third-brightest
                    in the
                    night sky, outshone by only Sirius and Canopus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Î± Centauri C, or more commonly, Proxima Centauri, is a small faint red dwarf (class M). Though not
                    visible
                    to the naked eye, Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun at a distance of 4.24 ly (1.30
                    pc),
                    slightly closer than Î± Centauri AB. Currently, the distance between Proxima Centauri and Î± Centauri
                    AB is
                    about 13,000 AU (0.21 ly), equivalent to about 430 times the radius of Neptune's orbit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proxima Centauri has two confirmed planets: Proxima b or Î± Centauri Cb, an Earth-sized planet in the
                    habitable zone discovered in 2016, and Proxima d (Î± Centauri Cd), a candidate sub-Earth which orbits
                    very
                    closely to the star, announced in 2022. The existence of Proxima c (Î± Centauri Cc), a mini-Neptune
                    1.5
                    AU away discovered in 2019, is controversial. Î± Centauri A may have a Neptune-sized planet in the
                    habitable zone, though it is not yet known with certainty to be planetary in nature and could be an
                    artifact
                    of the discovery mechanism. Î± Centauri B has no known planets: Planet Î± Cen Bb, purportedly
                    discovered
                    in 2012, was later disproven, and no other planet has yet been confirmed.

                    The Alpha Centauri system as a whole has two confirmed planets, both of them around Proxima
                    Centauri. While
                    other planets have been claimed to exist around all of the stars, none of the discoveries have been
                    confirmed.

                    Proxima Centauri b is a terrestrial planet discovered in 2016 by astronomers at the European
                    Southern
                    Observatory (ESO). It has an estimated minimum mass of 1.17 ME (Earth masses) and orbits
                    approximately 0.049
                    AU from Proxima Centauri, placing it in the star's habitable zone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The discovery of Proxima Centauri c was formally published in 2020 and could be a super-Earth or
                    mini-Neptune. It has a mass of roughly 7 ME and orbits about 1.49 AU from Proxima Centauri with a
                    period of 1,928 days (5.28 yr). In June 2020, a possible direct imaging detection of the planet
                    hinted
                    at the presence of a large ring system. However, a 2022 study disputed the existence of this
                    planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A 2020 paper refining Proxima b's mass excludes the presence of extra companions with masses above
                    0.6 ME at
                    periods shorter than 50 days, but the authors detected a radial-velocity curve with a periodicity of
                    5.15
                    days, suggesting the presence of a planet with a mass of about 0.29 ME. This planet, Proxima
                    Centauri
                    d, was confirmed in 2022.
                </p>
                <p>

                    In 2021, a candidate planet named Candidate 1 (abbreviated as C1) was detected around Alpha Centauri
                    A,
                    thought to orbit at approximately 1.1 AU with a period of about one year, and to have a mass between
                    that of
                    Neptune and one-half that of Saturn, though it may be a dust disk or an artifact. The possibility of
                    C1
                    being a background star has been ruled out. If this candidate is confirmed, the temporary name C1
                    will most likely be replaced with the scientific designation Alpha Centauri Ab in accordance with
                    current
                    naming conventions.

                    GO Cycle 1 observations are planned for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for planets
                    around
                    Alpha Centauri A, as well as observations of Epsilon Muscae. The coronographic observations, which
                    occurred on July 26 and 27, 2023, were failures, though there are follow-up observations in March
                    2024.
                    Pre-launch estimates predicted that JWST will be able to find planets with a radius of 5 RðŸœ¨ at 1â€“3
                    AU.
                    Multiple observations every 3â€“6 months could push the limit down to 3 RðŸœ¨. Post-processing
                    techniques
                    could push the limit down to 0.5â€“0.7 RðŸœ¨. Post-launch estimates based on observations of HIP 65426 b
                    find that JWST will be able to find planets even closer to Alpha Centauri A and could find a 5 RðŸœ¨
                    planet at
                    0.5â€“2.5 AU. Candidate 1 has an estimated radius between 3.3â€“11 RðŸœ¨ and orbits at 1.1 AU. It is
                    therefore likely within the reach of JWST observations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first claim of a planet around Alpha Centauri B was that of Alpha Centauri Bb in 2012, which was
                    proposed to be an Earth-mass planet in a 3.2-day orbit. This was refuted in 2015 when the apparent
                    planet was shown to be an artifact of the way the radial velocity data was processed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A search for transits of planet Bb was conducted with the Hubble Space Telescope from 2013 to 2014.
                    This
                    search detected one potential transit-like event, which could be associated with a different planet
                    with a
                    radius around 0.92 RðŸœ¨. This planet would most likely orbit Alpha Centauri B with an orbital period
                    of 20.4
                    days or less, with only a 5% chance of it having a longer orbit. The median of the likely orbits is
                    12.4
                    days. Its orbit would likely have an eccentricity of 0.24 or less. It could have lakes of molten
                    lava
                    and would be far too close to Alpha Centauri B to harbour life. If confirmed, this planet might be
                    called Alpha Centauri Bc. However, the name has not been used in the literature, as it is not a
                    claimed
                    discovery.
                </p>

                <h2 class="semiImportant">Hypothetical planets</h2>
                <p>
                    Additional planets may exist in the Alpha Centauri system, either orbiting Alpha Centauri A or Alpha
                    Centauri B individually, or in large orbits around Alpha Centauri AB. Because both stars are fairly
                    similar
                    to the Sun (for example, in age and metallicity), astronomers have been especially interested in
                    making
                    detailed searches for planets in the Alpha Centauri system. Several established planet-hunting teams
                    have
                    used various radial velocity or star transit methods in their searches around these two bright
                    stars.
                    All the observational studies have so far failed to find evidence for brown dwarfs or gas giants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2009, computer simulations showed that a planet might have been able to form near the inner edge
                    of Alpha
                    Centauri B's habitable zone, which extends from 0.5â€“0.9 AU from the star. Certain special
                    assumptions, such
                    as considering that the Alpha Centauri pair may have initially formed with a wider separation and
                    later
                    moved closer to each other (as might be possible if they formed in a dense star cluster), would
                    permit an
                    accretion-friendly environment farther from the star. Bodies around Alpha Centauri A would be able
                    to
                    orbit at slightly farther distances due to its stronger gravity. In addition, the lack of any brown
                    dwarfs
                    or gas giants in close orbits around Alpha Centauri make the likelihood of terrestrial planets
                    greater than
                    otherwise. A theoretical study indicates that a radial velocity analysis might detect a hypothetical
                    planet of 1.8 ME in Alpha Centauri B's habitable zone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Radial velocity measurements of Alpha Centauri B made with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet
                    Searcher
                    spectrograph were sufficiently sensitive to detect a 4 ME planet within the habitable zone of the
                    star (i.e.
                    with an orbital period P = 200 days), but no planets were detected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Current estimates place the probability of finding an Earth-like planet around Alpha Centauri at
                    roughly
                    75%. The observational thresholds for planet detection in the habitable zones by the radial velocity
                    method are currently (2017) estimated to be about 50 ME for Alpha Centauri A, 8 ME for Alpha
                    Centauri B, and
                    0.5 ME for Proxima Centauri.

                <p>
                    Early computer-generated models of planetary formation predicted the existence of terrestrial
                    planets around
                    both Alpha Centauri A and B, but most recent numerical investigations have shown that the
                    gravitational pull of the companion star renders the accretion of planets difficult. Despite these
                    difficulties, given the similarities to the Sun in spectral types, star type, age and probable
                    stability of
                    the orbits, it has been suggested that this stellar system could hold one of the best possibilities
                    for
                    harbouring extraterrestrial life on a potential planet.

                <p>
                    In the Solar System, it was once thought that Jupiter and Saturn were probably crucial in perturbing
                    comets
                    into the inner Solar System, providing the inner planets with a source of water and various other
                    ices.
                    However, since isotope measurements of the deuterium to hydrogen (D/H) ratio in comets Halley,
                    Hyakutake,
                    Haleâ€“Bopp, 2002T7, and Tuttle yield values approximately twice that of Earth's oceanic water, more
                    recent
                    models and research predict that less than 10% of Earth's water was supplied from comets. In the Î±
                    Centauri
                    system, Proxima Centauri may have influenced the planetary disk as the Î± Centauri system was
                    forming,
                    enriching the area around Alpha Centauri with volatile materials. This would be discounted if, for
                    example, Î± Centauri B happened to have gas giants orbiting Î± Centauri A (or vice versa), or if Î±
                    Centauri A
                    and B themselves were able to perturb comets into each other's inner systems, as Jupiter and Saturn
                    presumably have done in the Solar System. Such icy bodies probably also reside in Oort clouds of
                    other
                    planetary systems. When they are influenced gravitationally by either the gas giants or disruptions
                    by
                    passing nearby stars, many of these icy bodies then travel star-wards. Such ideas also apply to the
                    close approach of Alpha Centauri or other stars to the Solar system, when, in the distant future,
                    the Oort
                    Cloud might be disrupted enough to increase the number of active comets.

                <p>
                    To be in the habitable zone, a planet around Alpha Centauri A would have an orbital radius of
                    between about
                    1.2 and 2.1 AU so as to have similar planetary temperatures and conditions for liquid water to
                    exist.
                    For the slightly less luminous and cooler Î± Centauri B, the habitable zone is between about 0.7 and
                    1.2
                    AU.

                    With the goal of finding evidence of such planets, both Proxima Centauri and Î± Centauri AB were
                    among the
                    listed "Tier-1" target stars for NASA's Space Interferometry Mission (S.I.M.). Detecting planets as
                    small as
                    three Earth-masses or smaller within two AU of a "Tier-1" target would have been possible with this
                    new
                    instrument. The S.I.M. mission, however, was cancelled due to financial issues in 2010.
